the install disc to correct the problem.

2.4. Known Issues

* It is _not_ advisable to install the game into the Windows folder (usually
  C:\Windows), a subfolder of the Windows folder, nor the root of the system
  drive (usually C:\).

* It is recommended to close all other running programs before installing the
  game, to reduce the risk of software conflicts.

* Mobile Solutions are not yet fully supported and should be considered
supported “as is” with the limitations that they impose
